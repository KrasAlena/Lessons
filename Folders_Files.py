# **************************************************************************************
# EXERCISE 1
# Create an app that:
#
# Would create a file "Text.txt" with the full text obtained by running "import this" in the python code.
# Would print the text from the created file
# It would add today's date and time to the last line of the created file
# Numbered lines of text (a number added at the beginning of each).
# In the created file, the line "Beautiful is better than ugly." would change to "Beautiful is better than ugly."
# Would print the entire text of the file in reverse
# It would print the number of words, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters in the text of the file
# It would copy all the text of the created file to the new file, in UPPERCASE letters only
# **************************************************************************************

Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!''')
