'''
Before implementing the function, first write at least 7 tests for it.
Then, try to run them. Clearly, they will fail immediately.
Start implementing the function after each step try running your tests to see if your implementation is correct.
Use this approach to implement the function make_chocolate to solve the following problem: We want to make a package
of goal kilos of chocolate. We have small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). Return the number of small bars
to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. Return -1 if it can't be done.
